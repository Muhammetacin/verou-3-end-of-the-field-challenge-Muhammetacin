# Interface Simple 12

I have recreated the interface with the same look and feel of the original. It's a typical card element. An image on the topside with a heading and a body text. I added a random image from Pexels.com and trying to get a similar font to make it look better. I am happy with the end result. I only used Sass CSS and HTML to accomplish this card.
