# Field test - Interface Simple 12, 15 & Complex 6

My assignment were Simple 12 (& 15) interface and Complex 6 interface. On the webpage both my design and the original image (which I tried to replicate) are shown. With the help of buttons you can navigate back and forth between homepage and exercis, which only has 3 buttons that redirect to the exercises.
